# SpaceX-Dataset
DS 1: Data Analysis, Visualization &amp; Databases Final Project Guidelines 

## Introduction 

This project is a final project for my Data Science(1) class at Make School. I chose this dataset because not only I would love to intern for SpaceX but I'm also a big fan of Elon Musk work throughout the past years. After the new successful launch of Falcon Heavy, there were a few speculations over Elon's twitter and ULA between the Falcon Heavy vs. Delta IV, as a curious student I decided to investigate these datasets using data statistic.

### Project Summary

For your final project in this course, you will choose your own dataset to clean, investigate, and analyze. 
On the final day of class, you will give a brief (4-6 min) presentation about your dataset, your methodology, and your findings.
You may choose to work alone or with one partner on this project. Any dataset you choose should be approved by the instructors before beginning.

## Hold on tight and I hope you enjoy this data exploration.

### 1st Dataset - 

#### Context

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.

Under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX is flying numerous cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station, for a total of at least 20 flights under the Commercial Resupply Services contract. In 2016, NASA awarded SpaceX a second version of that contract that will cover a minimum of 6 additional flights from 2019 onward. In the near future, SpaceX will carry crew as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program as well. The dragon was designed from the outset to carry astronauts and SpaceX is in the process of upgrading Dragon to make it crew-ready. SpaceX is the world’s fastest-growing provider of launch services and has over 70 future missions on its manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts. These include commercial satellite launches as well as NASA and other US Government missions.

#### Content

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.

#### Acknowledgements

The data was scraped from the SpaceX and NASA website.

#### Inspiration

Has the rate of SpaceX rocket launches increased in the past decade? How many missions do you predict will be launched in 2018?

### Second Dataset - 

#### Context

SpaceX designs manufacture and launch advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets - SpaceX

#### Content

The dataset contains mission information for rocket launches conducted by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp).

#### Acknowledgements

Data were obtained via Wikipedia's entry for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

#### Inspiration

Do you anticipate an increase in launches with the introduction of the Falcon Heavy? How has launch rate increased over time? Do you predict a shift in payload orbits for upcoming launches? How has the customer diversity changed over the years?
